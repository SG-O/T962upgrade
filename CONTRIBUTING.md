## Reporting bugs ##

Before creating bug reports, please perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/SG-O/airMon/issues) to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible.

If you find a closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.
